# Single Page Application Routing Using Hash or URL

One of the most asked code questions during a front-end interview is "Can you create a single page application with routes, without a framework?" In this tutorial, I show you how to create a custom routing system for your single page application using either the hash or URL method...without a framework.

This tutorial shows you how to build a Single Page App using vanilla JavaScript. I show you how to implement client-side routing both ways (hash or URL) in an easy-to-use format that can be replicated for any project.
